# Slogger
Slogger is a social media-style blog platform that allows users to post their own blogs, view other users' blogs, and interact with them through comments, likes, and shares. This web version is built with React, Tailwind, and Material UI and connects to the main server at https://github.com/sphamandla-s/slogger.
